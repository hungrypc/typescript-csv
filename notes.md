# Notes

## Enums
We mainly use enums to signal to other devs what we're trying to get here.

Enums...

- Follow near-identical syntax rules as normal objects
- Creates an object with the same keys and values when converted from ts to js
- Primary goal is to signal to other engineers that these are all closely related values
- Use whenever we have a small fixed set of values that are all closely related and known at compile time
